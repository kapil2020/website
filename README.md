## 🎓 About Me
I am a **Final-year PhD Researcher** at **IIT Kharagpur**, specializing in travel behavior, sustainable mobility, and air quality management. My work focuses on building data-driven tools to make urban transportation systems cleaner, safer, and more equitable.

Previously, I earned my **M.Tech in Transportation Engineering** from **IIT Roorkee** and my **B.Tech in Civil Engineering** from **RTU, Kota**.

## 🔬 Research Focus
My doctoral research explores the intersection of human mobility and environmental impact, specifically:
* **Travel Behavior Modeling:** Analyzing decision-making in urban transit.
* **Sustainable Mobility:** Developing frameworks for low-carbon transportation.
* **Air Quality Analytics:** Assessing the environmental footprint of urban traffic (e.g., [India Air Quality Dashboard](https://github.com/kapil2020/india-air-quality-dashboard)).
* **Data-Driven Policy:** Leveraging Python and Julia for large-scale urban data analytics.
